# MBF Manifests

This repository contains copies of the AndroidManifest.xml file for each Beat Saber version supported by ModsBeforeFriday.

These files are located in the releases tab.

## Use of these files
If the user decides to downgrade the game using MBF, then if they wish to modify the APK manifest,
it is useful to know what this manifest is before the downgrading process. Otherwise they would have to be prompted to modify the manifest after the game is downgraded but before it is patched,
which increases the complexity of the modding process.
